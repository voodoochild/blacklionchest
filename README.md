# Black Lion Chest

This is the repository for [Black Lion Chest](http://blacklionchest.co.uk/), a
[Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/) blog aiming to provide interesting
articles and useful tools for other players. I’d be more than happy to explain how it works,
if you’re interested or would like to reuse the code to run your own blog.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [HarpJS](http://harpjs.com/)

## Setup

- `git clone https://github.com/voodoochild/blacklionchest.git`
- `cd blacklionchest`
- `npm install && bower install`
- `harp server _harp`

## Todo

- static versioning of assets
- configure correct cache headers for all assets
- analyze performance and decrease time to first paint
