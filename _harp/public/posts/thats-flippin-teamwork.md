This lunch time I hopped onto my lv65 ranger to do a spot of leveling in
Sparkfly Fen, and saw a couple of people talking in map chat about the fact
that Tequatl was due to spawn shortly. I made my way over and found a few
people tagged up and explaining the key parts of the encounter for anyone
who didn't know it already. Sure enough, the fight started and everyone did
what they were supposed to. Map chat was largely free of antagonising, and
with five minutes to spare we killed the dragon and collected our loot.

It’s not the first time that I’ve completed this fight in a non–pre made group,
but continues to surprise and impress me. Sure, it's been out long enough
that most people should know what they’re doing by now, but it nevertheless
takes coordination, and can go wrong quickly if people don't do what they’re
supposed to. It makes me really happy to see this sort of team play coming
together organically, and has always been one of the stand–out things about
Guild Wars 2. Long may it continue!
