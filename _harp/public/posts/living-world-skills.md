Throughout the first season of the Living World, we've been introduced to all manner of enemies and
abilities. One potentially interesting way that ArenaNet could commemorate the defeat of
[Scarlet Briar](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scarlet_Briar) and the end of this first season
would be to let us players unlock and use some of those trademark abilities for ourselves. Here are
a few abilities that I think could be unlocked for us all to use.

<h2 class="h3">Toxic Alliance</h2>

**Toxic Pollen** – *Place a Toxic Pollen (poison field) at your location. Enemies that get too close
to the pollen are afflicted with an Hallucination, either a poisonous Spider or an Ettin which
knocks them to the ground.*

The Toxic Alliance between the Krait and the Nightmare Court brought with them all kinds of nasty
abilities, mostly involving poison and torment, but what sticks out most prominently in my mind are
the [Hallucinations](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hallucination) given to those unlucky enough to
get too close to a patch of [Toxic Pollen](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Toxic_Pollen). They can
take one of several forms, including a Spider with a poison attack, and an Ettin which knocks
players down.

## Molten Alliance

**Molten Effigy** – *Grant might and fury to allies.*

The Dredge and Flame Legion Charr that make up the Molten Alliance bring lots of painful skills to
bear on players, including blinding ash clouds and jets of lava, but to me the most visually iconic
element are the hulking [Molten Effigies](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Molten_Effigy).
While it might be considered as cheating to include a mob in a list of skills, but go with it.
Although the skill sounds fairly standard, might and fury stacking are always welcome (and harder
for some professions than others); the main draw to use this skill would be the animation: a
ghostly, roaring Molten Effigy that appears around your character briefly. Totally badass.

## Aetherblades

**Aetherized Shielding** – *Completely negate damage and conditions for a brief time.*

Scarlet's Tyrian sky pirate [Aetherblades](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aetherblade) have,
arguably, the most infuriating and annoying skillset of all of her forces. A
[Shocking Aura](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shocking_Aura) that stuns you when you attack,
[Arc Lightning](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arc_Lightning) which jumps between players, doing
increasing levels of damage, and
[Aetherized Shielding](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aetherized_Shielding) which grants complete
invulnerability. It's this last skill that I think players should be able to unlock, albeit with a
fairly short duration and long cooldown.

## The Orders of Tyria

While evacuating and, eventually, reclaiming Lion's Arch, members of the three
[Orders of Tyria](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orders) sold buffs to players to help in the
fight. Each of these was not only very useful, but had a distinctive animation. It would be very
cool indeed if ArenaNet made versions of these skills available for players to unlock.

**Priory Aethershield** – *Generate an aethershield. Increases toughness and vitality. Decreases
duration of applied conditions by 50%.*

The aethershield gives players a shimmering green forcefield and improves survivability for a short
time. While it's very similar to my earlier suggestion to give players complete invulnerability
via **Aetherized Shielding**, I see this version as having a longer duration and/or shorter cooldown
and being for more general survivability, as opposed to something you might pop to soak one large
hit.

**Vigil Valiance** – *Gain valiance, increasing your size, power and precision.*

Also, *YOU TURN BIG AND RED*. This is the buff that I always ran with and works for everyone as a
simple ‘pop this and do more damage’ skill. It totally reminds me of using
[Bestial Wrath](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=19574/bestial-wrath) in World of Warcraft: when a big
red Core Hound is sprinting towards you, you know that it's time to be somewhere else!

**Quickness of Whispers** – *Gain quickness.*

As above, the duration and cooldown can be manipulated to tune this skill and determine whether or
not it would be useful. Some professions don't have access to quickness at all, so I think that
there's definitely merit in having something as straightforward as this. When activated, players
turn small and gain a hazy, distortion–like effect (and then get all stabby).
