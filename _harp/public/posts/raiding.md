ArenaNet Studio Design Director, Chris Whiteside, [announced on the official forums][1] that there
will be a  [<abbr title="Collaborative Development Initiative">CDI</abbr>][2] on the subject of
guild raiding, backing up assumptions that were already being made in the community based on a new
'[Game Designer: Raid Content][3]' job posting that appeared on [arena.net][4] this week. This, of
course, has everybody scrambling to discuss how they think that they should be implemented, if at
all.

Raiding isn't something that I necessarily *expected* to eventually come to Guild Wars 2, but I'm
definitely in the camp that feel that it could be a very positive move. My MMO history includes a
lot of raiding in World of Warcraft, from release through to Wrath of the Lich King, and some of my
very best MMO memories (and friends) come from those experiences. Sure, there are a lot of not so
good memories, mostly on kill-less 'progress' nights, but that was seen as a necessary evil for the
eventual pay-off that was killing bosses and (hopefully) getting some fat loot.

We already have large-scale bosses by way of the revamped Tequatl and the Great Jungle Wurms, and
while these are more-or-less enjoyable, the fact that they exist in the open world does inevitably
introduce difficulties. The design decision has always been that these events should be visible to
everyone not only so that anyone can join in, but so that less experienced players could stumble
upon a group of players trying to take down some enormous beast, which makes Tyria look totally
badass. Before megaservers were introduced organised guilds worked hard to manipulate the overflow
system in order to create a 'clean' overflow with only guild members in it. This became more
difficult to achieve with the megaserver system implementation and world bosses being put on a set
timetable, but there were some concessions made by allowing guilds to trigger a boss encounter at a
time of their choosing.

If, as we're currently lead to believe, there is to be a shift in design principles on the cards by
allowing guilds to tackle boss encounters behind closed doors, it could be an indication that ANet
is trying to draw in players who may have avoided Guild Wars 2 because of the lack of strong PvE
end-game, or those who have left the game due to the same perceived shortcomings.
