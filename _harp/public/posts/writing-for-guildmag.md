It’s been far too long since I posted anything here—or wrote anything at all—but in an effort to
keep this project rolling along I thought that it would be fun to draw attention to the work that I
did at [GuildMag][1] earlier in the year. Although I’ve  stepped back recently,
largely due to a lack of impetus to write articles (and partly due to a burgeoning obsession with
the LCG [Android: Netrunner][2]), they’re a very talented team and I miss working with them. I hope
to be able to get back to it before too much time has passed, possibly starting with some coverage
of EGX in Birmingham at the end of September.

I’m really happy with some of the content that I was able to contribute, so if you haven’t read
it already, please cast your glance over the following:

- [Masteries; or how I learned to love horizontal progression][3]
- [Rezzed Report: Stronghold & Desert borderlands][4]
- [Forging a legend less random][5]
- [What Does ‘Challenging Content’ Mean for Guild Wars 2?][6]

Much of that speculation can now be replaced with actual *facts*; a novelty that will be
repeated in a fortnight when Mike O’Brien and Colin Johanson take to the stage at PAX Prime to
talk about the ever–vague ‘challenging group content’. I'll be on the edge of my seat both with a
rabid sense of excitement, and to see how much I got right!
