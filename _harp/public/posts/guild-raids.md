ArenaNet Studio Design Director, Chris Whiteside, [announced][1] on the official forums that there
will be a  <abbr title="Collaborative Development Initiative">CDI</abbr> on the subject of
guild raiding, backing up assumptions that were already being made in the community based on a new
[Game Designer: Raid Content][2] job posting that appeared on their site this week. This, of
course, has everybody scrambling to discuss how they think that they should be implemented, if at
all.

Raiding isn’t something that I necessarily *expected* to eventually come to Guild Wars 2, but I’m
definitely in the camp that feel that it could be a very positive move. My MMO history includes a
lot of raiding in World of Warcraft, from release through to Wrath of the Lich King, and some of my
very best memories (and friends) come from those experiences. Sure, there are a lot of not so
good memories, mostly on kill–less ‘progress’ nights, but that was seen as a necessary evil for the
eventual pay–off that was killing bosses and (hopefully) getting some fat loot.

We already have large–scale bosses by way of the revamped Tequatl and the Great Jungle Wurms, and
while these are more–or–less enjoyable, the fact that they exist in the open world does inevitably
introduce difficulties. The design decision has always been that these events should be visible to
everyone not only so that anyone can join in, but so that less experienced players could stumble
upon a group of players trying to take down some enormous beast, which makes Tyria look totally
badass. Before megaservers were introduced organised guilds worked hard to manipulate the overflow
system in order to create a ‘clean’ overflow with only guild members in it. This became more
difficult to achieve with the megaserver system implementation and world bosses being put on a set
timetable, but there were some concessions made by allowing guilds to trigger a boss encounter at a
time of their choosing.

### Do we need raiding?

If, as we’re currently lead to suspect, there is to be a shift in design principles on the cards by
allowing guilds to tackle boss encounters behind closed doors, it could be an indication that ArenaNet
is trying to draw in new or returning players; those who may have avoided Guild Wars 2 because of the
lack of strong PvE end–game, or those who have left the game due to the same perceived shortcomings.

In most games, the classic reason for completing raid content is to progress to the next step on the
gear treadmill (a phrase commonly used to denote armor and weapons becoming obsolete with each major
release, to be replaced with newly added items with higher stats). The highest level of gear in Guild
Wars 2 is ascended, which only offers around a 5% improvement over readily available exotic items. I
would be surprised to see ascended displaced any time soon, which suggests that the main reasons for
confronting guild raids would be similar to those for taking on Tequatl or the Jungle Wurms:

- the **challenge** of figuring out how to beat it
- having **fun** working together within a community
- a rare chance for **ascended items**
- **unique skins**
- **unique achievements**

### How would they work?

Guilds come in all shapes and sizes, and it’s likely that any new guild raiding system would have to
be one–size–fits–all, potentially scaling from 10 players up to 50, or even more. It was always painful
being left on the bench for raid night because I was number 41 for a 40–man group, but it’s likely
that ArenaNet would want to implement some kind of capping (as opposed to open world bosses that often involve
all 150 players in a single overflow instance). This would be done in order to allow the encounters and
mechanics to be more tightly designed: something which works well and is fun for 20 people might *suck*
if you try to scale it up to work for 120 people. That said, the idea of having to potentially exclude
some members of the guild from joining in doesn’t really sit well with what I interpret to be ArenaNet’s
design philosophy, so this is likely to be a subject which is hotly discussed when the topic opens for
discussion on the forums.

With regards to the in–game technicalities of how raids might fit in, I imagine that we’ll be looking at
fully instanced raids, potentially activated in the same way as existing guild missions (as possibly linked
to some form of guild housing system). Whether these raids will tie in with in–game canon, or whether
they’ll be incorporated as some kind of ‘challenge’ arena is yet to be seen. Will they be long explorable
dungeons in the vein of [Molten Core][3] with multiple bosses, or ‘straight to the point’ single boss kills
like [Onyxia][4]? No idea, but in an ideal world (for me) I think we’d have access to both.

### Is this the right move for Guild Wars 2?

In short: I think so, yes. With the lack of a gear treadmill, players won’t feel compelled to seek
out raid content in order to keep up with the best gear on offer, and as such won’t fall behind if they
choose not to participate. Those of us with raiding backgrounds should relish the idea of ArenaNet
creating engaging and challenging large–scale PvE content, something which has definitely been lacking
since release, despite the addition of Fractals. There are definitely a lot of undesirable aspects that
can creep into the community when hardcore raiding is a focus, but I believe that the fact that they would
likely be pitched as an optional side–attraction and not the only end–game option available to players
would go some way to prevent that from developing.
